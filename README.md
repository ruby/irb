# IRB

IRB stands for "interactive Ruby" and is a tool to interactively execute Ruby expressions read from the standard input.

The `irb` command from your shell will start the interpreter.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'irb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install irb

## Usage

Use of irb is easy if you know Ruby.

When executing irb, prompts are displayed as follows. Then, enter the Ruby expression. An input is executed when it is syntactically complete.

```
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> 1+2
#=> 3
irb(main):002:0> class Foo
irb(main):003:1>   def foo
irb(main):004:2>     print 1
irb(main):005:2>   end
irb(main):006:1> end
#=> nil
```

The Readline extension module can be used with irb. Use of Readline is default if it's installed.
