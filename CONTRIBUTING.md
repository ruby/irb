## Build and test

Please follow the ["Making Changes To Standard Libraries"](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/contributing/making_changes_to_stdlibs_md.html) guideline.

## Test manually

Use the following command to run irb using the source files in the `/lib` directory (rather than the irb that came with Ruby):

```
bundle exec exe/irb
```
