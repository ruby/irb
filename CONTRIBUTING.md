## Build and test

Please follow the ["Making Changes To Standard Libraries"](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/contributing/making_changes_to_stdlibs_md.html) guideline.

## Test manually

Make sure the `exe/irb` executable uses the `/lib` directory as source with `bundle exec`:

```
bundle exec exe/irb
```
